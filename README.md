## System requirements
```
We run all of our code on the Linux system. The requirements of this system are as follows:
- Operating System: Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS
- CPU: IntelÂ® Xeon(R) Platinum 8370C CPU @ 2.80GHz (128GB) 
- GPU: NVIDIACorporationGA100 (A100 SXM480GB)
```

## Data 
```
For DDA prediciton, we use two datasets, including Cdataset and Fdataset. For each dataset, the detailed description is as follows:
- Drug_mol2vec: The mol2vec embeddings for drugs to construct the association network
- DrugFingerprint, DrugGIP: The similarity measurements of drugs to construct the similarity network
- DiseaseFeature: The disease embeddings to construct the association network
- DiseasePS, DiseaseGIP: The similarity measurements of diseases to construct the similarity network
- Protein_ESM: The ESM-2 embeddings for proteins to construct the association network
- DrugDiseaseAssociationNumber: The known drug disease associations
- DrugProteinAssociationNumber: The known drug protein associations
- ProteinDiseaseAssociationNumber: The known disease protein associations

For DTA prediciton, we use two datasets, including Davis and Kiba datasets. For each dataset, the detailed processing methods are as follows:
we use creat_data.py to generate data that conforms to the model's input requirements.

For 3D molecule optimizaiton, we use PDBbind dataset to pretrain model, and the dataset is downloaded from http://www.pdbbind.org.cn/.
Following this, process this dataset by preprocessing.py
